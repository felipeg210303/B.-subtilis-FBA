# B. subtilis FBA

Objective of this repository: To make genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) of Bacillus subtilis easily accesible and comprehensible in one single place even for people with low programming skills and allow them to make hypothesis with the use of this models and Flux Balance Analysis (FBA)

You can find an explained version of all of this the following Jupyter Notebook : <>

Here we are going to develop a repository of genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) available for Bacillus subtilis which are reviewed and well documented. We are also going to include some use cases and examples for each model and compare the results obtained between models with the computational tool of Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) performed in python using the library "cobrapy" based in COnstraint Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) and with experimental data.

Also, ideally we are going to try to:
* Implement visually for users that are not familiar with programming, GitHub and/or FBA through one of the following:
	> Graphic network fluxes visualization similar to ESCHER-FBA: <https://sbrg.github.io/escher-fba/#/> 
	> Web-based or desktop app to implement FBA
* Compare experimentally the model(s) when a gene knock-out has occurred, which ultimately means doing gene knock-outs in the lab.
